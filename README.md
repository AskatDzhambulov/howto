How To Do Things With Computers
=====

Placeholder repository for possible future guides to foundational tech tasks for CfA projects: how to open data, how to prepare Rails, how to install Postgres, etc.

The guides here serve two purposes:

1. Code for America software documentation *should link here for common tasks* like setting up a dev environment or framework. We prefer a tightly-edited, central collection of the most common tasks to everyone re-writing their own versions.
2. Guides here should be normative, describing the simplest, lowest-friction ways of getting common things done. If your app or library doesn’t work with the directions here, consider whether you can *modify it so that it does* rather than making a change to a guide.

Current Guides
--------------

* [Python Virtualenv](Python-Virtualenv.md), “an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects.”
* [Ruby RVM](Ruby-RVM.md), for the Ruby programming language and its version manager to install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments.
