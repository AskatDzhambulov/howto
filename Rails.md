Ruby on Rails
=============

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity.

Many Rails apps may have project-specific install instructions covered in their README, but this guide covers the general steps needed for most Rails apps, and gives context for those steps.

### 1. Follow the Ruby howto

First, follow the instructions in [Ruby.md](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Ruby.md) to install Ruby and RVM (the Ruby Version Manager).

### 2. Clone the project

Use `git clone` to clone the project locally and `cd` into the project directory.

### 3. (Sometimes) Install the project-specific version of Ruby

Some projects specify a version of Ruby that is required or recommended. You can find this by opening the `Gemfile` and looking for a line like:

`ruby '2.1.5'`

To install that version of Ruby with RVM, run:

`rvm install 2.1.5`

To switch the current Ruby version being used, use `rvm use`, like this:

`rvm use 2.1.5`

### 4. Install Ruby dependencies with bundler

Run:

`bundle install`

to install the Ruby dependencies (called "gems") for the project, which are listed in the `Gemfile`.

### 5. Database configuration

Most Rails applications will use SQLite or Postgres when in development mode. Apps using SQLite generally require no configuration.

You can configure the application to use your local database credentials in the `config/database.yml` file.

### 6. Database setup

You can set up the database by running:

`bundle exec rake db:setup`

(This actually runs three separate commands â€” `db:create`, `db:migrate`, and `db:seed` which gets your database all setup.)


### 7. Running the app

Lastly, you can run the app with:

`bundle exec rails s`

Or if you want to access a console (REPL) for the app, you can run:

`bundle exec rails c`


## Deploying to Heroku
